%% KCVating the kernel scale (sigma for rbf)

%choose the no of sigmas carefully, with the noOfSeeds & K in mind, because
% the code is going to train once and predict twice (test, train)
% noOfSeeds*K*noOfSigmas models. For rbf kernels this is going to take
% WHILE (test to see how much 1 model takes to train, if it's t minutes than the
% code is going to take t*noOfSeeds*K*noOfSigmas/60 hours !! For 10 minutes
% with the current parameters if it's 10 minutes per model it's 10*3*4*4/60
% = 8 hours. Measure time and change parameters yourself. 

%This is with the old generic KCV function, the updated one using parallel
%pools is faster, but no guarantee on how much faster, though probably a
%lot.
